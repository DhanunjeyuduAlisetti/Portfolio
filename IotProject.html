    <h1 class="heading1" id="heading">Iot based Aleart System for deaf and hard hearing</h1>
    <p class="para">Deaf and people with hearing impairment face everyday challenges in identifying the occurrence of household sounds like door bell, child crying or phone ringing. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a low cost stand-alone device for deaf people to notify doorbell ringing who live alone in their house. The system is based on Raspberry pi which includes camera, vibrator, wireless GSM and bluetooth. When the visitor presses the doorbell, captured image is transferred to the wearable device which helps to know the right person at the door or intruder. After transferring image, wearable device vibrates to notify. Also, the message is sent to the owner through GSM. Visitorâ€™s image along with the date and time is sent to the server for retrieving information later. The system is reliable, effective, and easy to use and also enhances the security of the user. Keywords--- Alert System, Raspberry Pi Camera, Server, Bluetooth, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), Vibrator, TFT. </p>
